Caesura rulebook:
-----------------

Objective: Be the first player to reach 500 points, without running out of moves. 

Controls: 
-Player 1 (red) moves with WASD, player 2 (blue) moves with the arrow keys.
-press m to return to the menu at any time, and 'space' to begin a new game from the menu

Rules:
-If a player collides with the orange or green entity, the player loses all of their current tiles on the board
and is sent back to their starting position

-If two players collide, the player with the lower movement point count is sent back to their starting position

-When the Caesura effect happens, the number of tiles each player controls is added to their score

-When the Caesura effect happens, players can only move on tiles of their color or entity-captured tiles

-players can pick up items to increase their movement points or score

-There are three speeds of movement that can be controled by the three switches on the board and are designated
by three different speeds of music:
--normal speed: players control movement at a 1 input to 1 tile pace. Entities behave normally. 
--slow speed: each movement costs twice as many movement points, entities drop items slower.
--fast speed: players must constantly move, inputs simply change directions

-If a player moves against a wall during fast speed, they will induce a 'struggle' mechanic and lose movement points
at an incredibly fast rate.
